## üìÅ Projects

Below is a list of my completed projects, each housed in its own repository for clarity and ease of access:

- [Sprint 17 Final Project: Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-17-final-project)  
  Supervised learning project using logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting to predict customer churn from contract and service data.

- **Sprint 16**: No standalone project  
  Sprint 16 focused on unsupervised learning, but there was no project to share.

- [Sprint 15 Project: Computer Vision for Age Estimation](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-15-computer-vision)  
  Computer vision project using a ResNet-based regression model to predict age from face images, with applications in retail compliance and demographic analysis.

- [Sprint 14 Project: Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-14-nlp)  
  Supervised learning project using logistic regression and gradient boosting to classify movie reviews by sentiment, with a focus on text preprocessing.

- [Sprint 13 Project: Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-13-time-series)  
  Time series regression project using linear models, random forests, and ARIMA to forecast hourly taxi demand and identify key seasonal trends.

- [Sprint 12 Project: Numerical Methods for Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-12-numerical-methods)  
  Regression project comparing linear regression, random forest, LGBM, and CatBoost to predict used car prices while balancing speed and accuracy.

- [Sprint 11 Project: Linear Algebra Applications](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-11-linear-algebra)  
  Linear regression project using matrix algebra to predict insurance benefit usage, including data obfuscation techniques to preserve client privacy.

- [Sprint 10 Project: Industrial Gold Recovery Optimization](https://github.com/uberbeek/sprint-10-integrated-project-2)
